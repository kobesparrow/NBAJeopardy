# Learning Goals

The main goal of building NBAJeopordy was to implement object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. The game was built from scratch and utilizes array-prototype methods to extract and manipulate data. Additionally, the game was built using test-driven-development, test first, code second. We also supplanted Vanilla JS with Jquery for manipulation of the Dom.
